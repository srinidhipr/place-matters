# Place Matters!

The R code in PSet6RiskApp.R was written for Problem Set 6 of the course PSCI 207 at the University of Pennsylvania, Spring 2021. If run in R, it creates an interactive Shiny app displaying youth risk scores mapped onto Philadelphia counties, and a graph plotting poverty versus crime.
